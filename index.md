Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. Most 
researchers have data in spreadsheets, so it is the place that many research
projects start. 

We organise data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with the data, 
but computers require that data be organised in particular ways. In order
to use tools that make computation and data analysis more efficient, reusable and reproducible, such as programming 
languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that 
computers need the data to be organised. Since this is where most research projects start, 
this is where we want to start too!

In this lesson, you will learn:

- What the basic principles for using spreadsheets for good data organisation are and how to format 
data in spreadsheets for effective data use,
- What some common mistakes with formatting data in spreadsheets are and how to avoid them,
- Peculiarities of storing and handling dates in spreadsheets and how to avoid mistakes with dates,
- Validating data on input for basic quality assurance and control in spreadsheets and to limit incorrect data on entry, and
- How to export data from spreadsheets in a way that is useful for downstream applications or publications.

All these will help you to get your current data into a good shape and plan new data 
collections so less "data cleaning" and "data wrangling" is needed in the future.

In this lesson, however, you will *not* learn:
- How to do statistics and formulas in spreadsheets, or
- How to plot graphs using spreadsheets. 

There are many good tutorials available online on these topics. If you are looking to learn any of 
the above, a good reference is [Head First Excel](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Excel-learners-spreadsheets/dp/0596807694/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491594584&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+excel), published by O'Reilly.
