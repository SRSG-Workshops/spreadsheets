## Software

To interact with spreadsheets, you can use various software - for example Microsoft Excel, 
LibreOffice, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, Google Spreadsheets. Commands may differ a bit between programs, 
but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use a free and open source tool LibreOffice 
as it can open Excel spreadsheets, which is the format of the data we will work with during the lesson.

## Data  
Data for this lesson is borrowed from the SAFI (Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation) project - a currently 
running project which is looking at farming and irrigation methods. This is survey data relating to households and 
agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 
2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded to Android smartphones. 
The survey covered things such as household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), 
agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and types of livestock) 
and details about the household members.
 
We will be using a teaching version of the 
collected data (that has been intentionally 'messed up' for this lesson) and not the full dataset. The teaching 
data is part of the [Portal Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459) 
available on FigShare under the CC-BY license.
 
Download the following files:
- [SAFI_messy.xlsx](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502824)
- [SAFI_clean.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11492171)

We will be working with the "messy" version of the data (found in Excel file `SAFI_messy.xlsx`), 
which contains 3 tabs - "2016", "2017" and "dates".
You also have a "clean" version (found in CSV file `SAFI_clean.csv`), which is how the data should look like when well organised.
